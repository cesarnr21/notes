# Notes

#### some utilities
> To generate tables, use these: **[Markdown Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)** and **[HTML Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables)**

> to write comments in markdown that won't render: `[//]: # (commet: simple graphic)`

> markdown supports LaTex for math equations, for a later generator: **<https://editor.codecogs.com/>**
> use single `$` for inline math equations and dual `$$` for math blocks, or also specify `math` syntax. use `\\` for new lines within blocks

## Contents

-----------------------------


## TO DO
- [ ] write a script to scan for files for contents and paste them up there.
    - something like the [markdown formattter](https://github.com/cesarnr21/vault/blob/main/vault/mkdwn.py) you wrote for individual files but for the entire repository
- [ ] start using git pre-commit hooks, to stop compiled jupyter cells from being uploaded to repo
- [ ] go throught and this and fill in any blanks: **[teach yourself computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#networking)**
- [ ] add this game to javascritp folder: <https://play.elevatorsaga.com/>

# Stuff to get into
- Explore creating your own API
- Look into controlling a raspberry pi/linux boards throught wifi network, example, RACHEL PI
- TCP/IP Communications
- Unix Sockets vs IP Sockets: 
```txt
A UNIX socket, AKA Unix Domain Socket, is an inter-process communication mechanism that allows bidirectional data exchange between processes running on the same machine.
IP sockets (especially TCP/IP sockets) are a mechanism allowing communication between processes over the network. In some cases, you can use TCP/IP sockets to talk with processes running on the same computer (by using the loopback interface).
UNIX domain sockets know that theyâ€™re executing on the same system, so they can avoid some checks and operations (like routing); which makes them faster and lighter than IP sockets. So if you plan to communicate with processes on the same host, this is a better option than IP sockets.
```
