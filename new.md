### Practice
- these problems: <https://cses.fi/problemset/>
- [Facebook coding challenges](https://www.facebookrecruiting.com/portal/coding_puzzles)

## Experiments you can peform:

- **Feeback loop** with a motor. Use the STM32. Maybe buy a motor with an encoder

    - Try to do the same with a raspberry and save data to a csv file, then plot it

- Look at some projects of implenting RTOS:

# Stuff to get into
- Explore creating your own API
- Look into controlling a raspberry pi/linux boards throught wifi network, example, RACHEL PI
- TCP/IP Communications
- Unix Sockets vs IP Sockets: 
```txt
A UNIX socket, AKA Unix Domain Socket, is an inter-process communication mechanism that allows bidirectional data exchange between processes running on the same machine.
IP sockets (especially TCP/IP sockets) are a mechanism allowing communication between processes over the network. In some cases, you can use TCP/IP sockets to talk with processes running on the same computer (by using the loopback interface).
UNIX domain sockets know that theyâ€™re executing on the same system, so they can avoid some checks and operations (like routing); which makes them faster and lighter than IP sockets. So if you plan to communicate with processes on the same host, this is a better option than IP sockets.
```
